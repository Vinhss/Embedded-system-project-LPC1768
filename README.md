I. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Upon completion of this project, you will be able to:
•	Be able to use GPIO, ADC, TIMERS, SPI modules using multitask programming. 
•	Students have ability to develop multi-task programming using RTX-RTOS

II. SYSTEM DESIGN
A LPC1768 microcontroller is to be used as the basis of a greenhouse climate controller. It has the following sensors, actuators, and interfaces:
Sensors
	Temperature sensor: outputs a signal of 100mV/oC.
	Soil Moisture sensor: outputs a linear signal in the range 0V (very dry) to 4.5V (saturated).
	Light Sensor: outputs a linear signal whereby 0V is completely dark, 4V is bright sunlight.
Actuators (all activated by a logic signal)
	Water sprinkler,
	Heater,
	Light Source.
